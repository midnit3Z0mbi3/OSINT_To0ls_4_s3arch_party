Change DNS:

nano /etc/resolv.conf

NEVER remove the line that says nameserver 127.0.0.53. Comment it out by putting a pound/hash symbol at the beginning of that line.

add nameservers

nameserver 1.1.1.2
nameserver 1.0.0.2

check with this command - dig google.com | grep SERVER

sudo apt-get install resolvconf -y

nano /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head

add nameservers

nameserver 1.1.1.2
nameserver 1.0.0.2


sudo systemctl enable --now resolvconf.service
