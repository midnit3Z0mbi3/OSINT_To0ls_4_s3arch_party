deleting line 13 from sherloq/gui/noiseprint/utility/utilityRead.py and editing line 83 to remove the convert_dict_qtables call. Will fix error on sherloq gui.


on line 83 delete the following phrase:

(convert_dict_qtables(Image.open(stream).quantization)[tnum]).reshape((8, 8))

new line should look like the following

h = np.asarray
